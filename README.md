## What is Boron?

**Boron** is a dual-mode JSON data engine designed to make working with structured data simple and consistent. It uses a schema-driven, form-like system for creating and updating data, and a command-style interface for querying and deleting it. Instead of relying on a custom language, Boron works directly with JSON structures, offering the clarity and control of SQL-like operations without introducing new syntax.

**NOTE:** This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version.

## Why Boron?

Sometimes, you don't need a full database. You just need to query and tweak some JSON. Whether you're prototyping, building small-scale tools, handling mock APIs, or processing configuration files, Boron makes it fast and easy.

### Use Boron if you:
- Want to query JSON with clean, readable syntax
- Are tired of writing endless `for` loops and `if` conditions just to extract or modify data
- Prefer structured querying over chaotic key-chasing
- Love the elegance of SQL but need the flexibility of JSON
