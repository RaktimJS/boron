## What is JSQL?

**JSQL (JSON Specific Query Language)** is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for querying and manipulating JSON data using a familiar, SQL-like syntax. Inspired by the clarity and structure of traditional SQL, JSQL brings that same power to hierarchical JSON documents.

**NOTE:** This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version.

## Why JSQL?

Sometimes, you don't need a full database engine. You just need to query and tweak some JSON. Whether you're building small-scale tools, handling mock APIs, or processing configuration files, JSQL makes it fast and easy.

### Use JSQL if you:
- Want to query JSON with clean, readable syntax
- Are tired of writing endless `for` loops and `if` conditions just to extract or modify data
- Prefer structured querying over chaotic key-chasing
- Love the elegance of SQL but need the flexibility of JSON

## Features

- Select specific fields from JSON  
- Filter using conditions (`WHERE`)  
- Modify values inside nested structures  
- SQL-like syntax: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.  
- Lightweight and easy to use—no dependencies or bloat

> Think of it like SQL’s younger cousin who only works with JSON and doesn’t need a whole RDBMS to get stuff done.
