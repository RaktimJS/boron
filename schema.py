This module contains all functions for schema handling.

"""
The schema definition for that particular JSON is stored with the JSON file's path
as an object, and the JSON storing the cache is an array-type JSON at the topmost
level. Meaning, cache.json is an array that stores multiple JSON objects, each one
containing 2 attributes, "path" and "schema", where "path" stores the file path of
the JSON and "schema" stores the schema definition of the "JSON".
